    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing an intelligent algorithm to compute the cheapest path between two railway stations on a map. 
      The project was completed using SNCF Open Data and involved parsing station and route data to create a navigable graph. 
      The algorithm was implemented in C++, utilizing Dijkstra’s algorithms with early termination for efficient pathfinding.

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph of stations and routes parsed from map data</li>
      <li>Dijkstra’s algorithms with early termination for path planning (in C++ for efficiency and memory management)</li>
      <li>FastAPI API and Streamlit frontend and frontend separation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>C++:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design, API</li>
      <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JS:</strong> For frontend</li>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> API for some high level functions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting app is capable of dynamically computing optimal paths (in terms of price) through a network of stations, with potential applications in ticket sales.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future improvements include designing new algorithms to further improve the computation complexity and memory complexity.

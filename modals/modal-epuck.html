    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved programming a RTOS based robot to navigate a tunnel autonomously which means dealing with threads and memory management in a real-time operating system environment..
      The robot was equipped with various sensors, including infrared sensors for obstacle detection and a microphone for sound detection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Algorithm to deduct object distance from IR sensor readings</li>
      <li>PID to maintain the robot in the middle of the tunnel</li>
      <li>Frequency analysis algorithm using FFT to make the rpbot reactive to certain frequencies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-title">Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>C:</strong> Core logic and algorithm design</li>
      <li><strong>STM32:</strong> As the controlling chip of the system</li>
      <li><strong>IR Sensors:</strong> For object detection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The resulting robot is capable of navigating through a tunnel autonomously and can react to specific sound frequencies.
      The robot can maintain its position in the middle of the tunnel using a PID controller and can detect obstacles using infrared sensors.
